CMM is an automatic mod installer for Steam versions of Capuchin. It works almost perfectly and is very easy to use and understand.
It is not a fork of MMM, it is it's own application.

- [Releases](https://github.com/binguszingus/jambo-posready-embedded-7/releases/latest)
- [Add your Capuchin mods here! Send a PR! (OSS only)](https://github.com/jambo-posready-embedded-7/capuchinmodinfo)

## Why is CMM better than BMM?
- More stable and containing a less diverse feature set in order to make the features it needs work.
- Full cross compatability inbetween BepInEx 6 and MelonLoader 0.6.6+.
- Catalog filters and search.
- Able to make use of the BMM catalog.
